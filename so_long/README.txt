what i did : 
  1. loaded mlx, window and images.
  2. parsed the map;
  3. saved the map into a 2d array;
  4. translated the map into textures.
  5. player, collectible, exit textures.
  5. player actions and movement.
  3. norminate functions -> more than 25 lines;
  6. cleaner code by doin a structure for game which 
  includes all the games assets and actors (strcutures);
  2. window dynamic size for the map, not hard-coded.
  6. collectible action.
  7. win condition -> exit action.
  1. check map validation.
  // check for exit_path;
  // check for collectibles
  // check for characters in map;
  // check for valid walls (closed);
  // check for rectangular;
  10. memory leaks.
  11. moves counter.
  8. norminate whats left.

  what to do ? 
  9. error handle/argc argv;
  11. finishing up and evaluation.
